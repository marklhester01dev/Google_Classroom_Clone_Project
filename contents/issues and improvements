1. When a resize the browser to a smaller width, the browser has a scroll bar on x and y direction, and when I resize it to full view, the scrollbar doesn't disappear and stuck there.

2.The arrow-up button doesn't have an animation, much better if it has an animation that animates the arrow-up to arrow-down for enhance user interaction.
